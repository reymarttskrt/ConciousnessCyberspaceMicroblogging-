				<h6>DDOS Attack</h6>
			
					<a><strong>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) assaults are a type of malicious cyber-attacks that are used by hackers or cybercriminals to block access to a host system, network resource, or online service by its intended users.</strong></a>
					<p></p>
					
						
                <h5><strong>How to avoid DDOS Attack</strong></h5>
                <ul>
                    <p>While it is impossible to stop hackers from trying to launch a DDoS, careful preparation and preventive steps lessen the likelihood and potential consequences of an assault.
                         <p>Make a DDoS response strategy. Your security team should create an incident response strategy that guarantees staff members will react speedily and skillfully in the event of a DDoS. This program should include:</p>
                         <li>Confirm that you are under attack.</li>
                           <li>Understand the nature of the attack. </li>
                            <li>Don't provide sensitive or personally identifiable information such as your full name, phone number, home address or workplace to individuals you meet online, in chat rooms, social media or gaming platforms.</li>
                           </p>
                    </ul>
                                    <h5>Who are the ones that you can call?</h5>
                <ul><li><p>Do not hesitate to call 911. Report the cyber-harassment or cyberstalking to the police district where your business and home are located, along with all documentation. If you have proof of the perpetrator's identity, file a restraining order because you never know when the harassment will stop. </p></li></ul>

                 <h5>How to determine if you are experiencing Cyber Stalking?</h5>
                 <ul>
                    <p><li>Someone anonymously sending you too many unwanted or inappropriate messages.</li>
                         <li>Someone anonymously liked your old post on social media.</li>
                          <li>Someone manipulates you into talking to them online. Be wary.</li>
                           <li>They know everything about you, even your private life.</li>
                           
                       
                    </ul>
