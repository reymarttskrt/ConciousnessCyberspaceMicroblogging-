				<h6>Online Defamation</h6>
			
					<a><strong> Internet defamation generally involves the online publication of a false statement of fact that is harmful to one's reputation. There may be some exceptions or additional elements of showing malice where the plaintiff is a public figure.</strong></a>
					<p></p>
					
						
                <h5>What are the types of online defamation? Are you a victim of it?</h5>
                <ul>
                	
                    <p>There are two types of online defamation: Libel and Slander.
                    <li>Slander: Slander is the verbal dissemination of defamatory statements. For instance, in the event that an individual offers misleading expressions about you in a discourse, it will be de-fame. A podcast or video is another option for this.</li>
                    	<li> Libel: Libel is the spreading of defamation through written statements. Libel, for instance, refers to the publication of a defamatory article about you.</li></p></ul>

                     <h5>How would you avoid online defamation?</h5><ul>

                    <p>There are a few easy ways to avoid defamation:</p> 
                    	<p><li>Before you post something, make sure that your claim has evidences that come from reliable sources.</li>
                     <li> You may also not be aware of the entire story at times. Be diligent to find if that is the truth.</li>
                    	<li>  Always state your opinion as an opinion, not a fact, when expressing it.</li>
                    	<li>Consider the kinds of people whose reputations are most important to them. For instance, celebrities, politicians, and high-profile businesspeople, among others, are more likely to aggressively protect their reputations and sue those who attempt to harm it. Consider cautiously what you need to say regarding high-profile individuals before you say it.</li>
                    	</p></ul>
               
               <h5>What do you do and who do you contact if you're a victim of online defamation?</h5>
               <p> <ul><li>Depending on the content, social media offers a variety of flagging and reporting options for defamation. You might even be able to mark multiple things at once, like a defamatory video and the user's profile. </li>
             <p>In the accompanying segments, we will make sense of how you can report: </p>
                <li>Slanderous posts can be accessed by clicking on the post itself, slanderous videos can be accessed by clicking on the video, profiles or accounts of users who are slandering you can be accessed through Social Media's Defamation Reporting Form, and so on.</li>
                <li>You can also report content that violates community standards, such as nudity, hate speech, violent threats, and criminal behavior. Additionally, the Help Center offers guidance on how to report each kind of inappropriate content.</li>
