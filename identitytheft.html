				<h6>Identity Theft</h6>
			
					<a><strong>  Identity theft is when someone uses your personal or financial information without your permission. They might steal your name and address, credit card, or bank account numbers, Social Security number, or medical insurance account numbers. And they could use them to buy things with your credit cards, get new credit cards in your name, open a phone, electricity, or gas account in your name, steal your tax refund, and use your health insurance to get medical care pretend to be you if they are arrested.

                <h5><strong>How to avoid getting your Identity Stolen?</strong></h5>
                <ul>
                    <p><li> Destroy private records and statements. Tear up – or, if you prefer, shred – credit cards statements, solicitations, and other documents that contain private financial information.</li>
                     <li> Secure your mail. Empty you mailbox quickly, lock it or get a P.O. box so criminals don’t have a chance to snatch credit card pitches. Never mail outgoing bill payments and checks from home. They can be stolen from your mailbox and the payee’s name erased with solvents. Mail them from the post office or another secure location.</li>
                      <li> Safeguard your Social Security number. Never carry your card with you, or any other card that may have your number, like a health insurance card. Don’t put your number on your checks. It’s the primary target for identity thieves because it gives them access to your credit report and bank accounts..<l>
                      	<li>  Don’t leave a paper trail. Never leave ATM, credit card or gas station receipts behind.</li>
                      	 <li> Never let your credit card out of your sight. Worried about credit card skimming? Always keep an eye on your card or, when that’s not possible, pay with cash.</li>
                      	  <li>   Know who you’re dealing with. Whenever anyone contacts you asking for private identity or financial information, make no response other than to find out who they are, what company they represent and the reason for the call. If you think the request is legitimate, contact the company yourself and confirm what you were told before revealing any of your personal data.</li>
                      	   <li> Take your name off marketers’ hit lists. You can also cut down on junk mail and opt out of credit card solicitations.</li>
                      	    <li> Be more defensive with personal information. Ask salespeople and other if information such as Social Security or driver’s license number is absolutely necessary. Ask anyone who does require your Social Security number about their privacy policy and that you do not want your information given to anyone else.</li>
                      	      <li>  Monitor your credit report. Obtain and thoroughly review your credit report at least once a year to check for suspicious activity. If you find something, alert your card company or the creditor immediately. You may also look into credit protection services, which alerts you any time a change takes place with your credit report.</li>
                      	       <li> Review your credit cards statements carefully. Make sure you recognize the merchants, locations and purchases listed before paying the bill. If you don’t need or use department-store or bank-issued credit cards, consider closing the accounts.</li>
                          </p>
                    </ul>
                     <h5><strong>How to know if someone stole your identity?</strong></h5><p></p>
                     <p>
                     <ul><li>You’re alerted to a credit card charge you didn’t make.

Financial identity theft is one of the most common types of identity theft, and credit cards are a popular target. The rise in online shopping has made credit card fraud even more common.
Your online banking portal or app should allow you to set up alerts to email, call, or text you about suspected fraudulent credit card charges. If you get an alert, someone may have taken your identity. </li>
                     	<li> Your loan or credit card application was denied.

If you apply for a loan or line of credit and your application is denied, dig deeper. A rejection could indicate that your credit score is lower than you thought, possibly due to fraudulent activity. For example, someone may use your information to get new credit cards and not pay them off, leaving you responsible.
 </li>
                     	<li>There’s a change to your credit score.

Changes in your credit score can indicate identity theft. For example, if someone takes out utility bills in your name and doesn’t pay them, your credit score may dip. Checking your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) can help pinpoint the problem.

 </li>
                     	<li>There’s a new account you didn’t open under your name.

Once identity thieves obtain enough data, including your name and address, they might be able to open new accounts and credit cards. When you check your credit report, keep an eye out for new accounts that you didn’t open. Another red flag is if you start getting bank statements or bills addressed to you for accounts you don’t recognize.
 </li>
                     	<li>Your information was part of a data breach.

Companies are required to notify customers of data breaches that could impact them. For example, if you save your payment information and home address on a music streaming provider’s website and their database is hacked, identity thieves may get your data. Keep an eye out for notifications and read the news. The McAfee blog is another great resource for information on data breaches.
</li>
                     	<li>Debt collectors call about accounts you never opened.

If debt collectors start calling, be cautious, especially if they’re referring to accounts you aren’t familiar with. Don’t provide personal information to any collection agencies that call, as this can be a potential phishing scam. However, it’s a good idea to follow up on these cases by checking your credit report for new accounts. You could be liable if someone opened accounts under your name and didn’t pay them.
 </li>
                     	<li>You receive bills for medical services you never used.

Medical theft occurs when a fraudster imitates another person to get health care or supplies. For example, a person might use your identity to get prescription medication at a pharmacy. If you get unfamiliar medical bills, follow up. Incorrect medical records could impact your insurance premiums or interfere with your ability to get the care you need in the future.
 </li>
                     	<li> Mail is addressed to your home but with another person’s name.

This could be an indicator of synthetic identity theft. This occurs when a fraudster creates a fake identity using various people’s real information. For example, they may use your address and Social Security number and another person’s photo to create a fake persona that’s creditworthy. They can then take out credit cards in that fake person’s name.
 </li>
                     	<li>A tax return is filed under your name without your knowledge.

If you receive a confirmation of an annual tax filing before you’ve filed, take note. Criminals may try to file a tax return for another person to access their tax refund. Alternatively, you may find that you’re unable to e-file your taxes, which can occur if someone else has already filed under your name.
 </li>
                  </ul></p>

                                    <h5>What to do if your Identity is stolen?</h5><p>
                <ul><li>File a claim with your identity theft insurance. </li>
                	<li>Notify companies of your stolen identity. </li>
                	<li>File a report to your local government office that handles these kinds of incidents. </li>
                	<li>Contact your local police department. </li>
                	<li> Freeze your credit. </li>
                	<li>Sign up for a credit monitoring service. </li>
                	<li>Tighten security on your accounts. </li>
                	<li>Scan credit card and bank statements for unauthorized charges. </li>
