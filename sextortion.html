                <h5><strong>How to avoid Credit Card Fraud</strong></h5>
                <ul>
                    <p><li>You can avoid this entirely by simply never posting anything explicit about yourself. Never open attachments from anyone you do not know since this can lead to possibly compromising your electronic device with viruses and malware, possibly granting hidden access to your personal data and even your webcam. Finally, turning off or unplugging your electronic devices like a webcam when not in use can also help.</li>
                           </p>
                    </ul>
                                    <h5>Who are the ones that you can call?</h5>
                <ul><li><p>Anyone being extorted should contact the authorities. You can dial the police in your area or contact the 117 for assistance. Parents should be informed immediately if you are a minor as they will be the ones to contact the authorities.
                 </p></li></ul>

                 <h5>Determining who has been a victim to sextortion</h5>
                 <ul>
                    <p><li> Without looking at court cases of known victims your best chance of finding a possible victim will have to be based solely on a person's change in demeanor.
</li>
