				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<h5>Researchers<span> From 12 ICT 2</span></h5>
<p>
The developers are from Arellano University Jose Abad Santos, and their goal is to raise cybercrime awareness among teachers and students. Statista reported a significant increase in cybercrime in the Philippines in June 2021. We want to contribute to reducing the percentage of this type of crime associated with the field that we have chosen. As ICT students, we decided to build a website. A website that provides tips and advice to prevent yourself from becoming a victim of various types of cybercrime so that you can safely browse the internet. We made this website accessible to everyone, not just on our campus since we want to decrease the overall percentage of individuals and organizations who have been a victim of cybercrime in our country. Anyone who wants to learn more about cybercrimes can visit this website.
